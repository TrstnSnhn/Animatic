Rig Model Evaluation Package

This package is designed for evaluating an automatic rig generation model
based on image input. It is suitable for thesis-level experiments.

Metrics included:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) of keypoints

Usage:
1. Train your rigging model.
2. Prepare ground-truth keypoints for test images.
3. Import evaluate_rig_model from evaluation.py
4. Run evaluation on the test set.
5. Use results for tables and figures in your thesis.

This framework aligns with pose estimation and automatic rigging literature.
