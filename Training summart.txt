TRAINING CONFIGURATION
----------------------------------------
Batch size: 16
Learning rate: 0.001
Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Early stopping patience: 15 epochs

TRAINING RESULTS
----------------------------------------
Total training time: 545.82 minutes (9.1 hours)
Epochs completed: 78 (early stopped)
Best epoch: 63
Best validation loss: 0.003312

EVALUATION METRICS (Test Set)
----------------------------------------
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.004492
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.034205
PCK @ 0.1 threshold: 86.26%
Average inference time: 60.16 ms
Throughput: 16.6 FPS

INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
----------------------------------------
- MSE of 0.0045 means average squared error is very small
- MAE of 0.034 means keypoints are off by ~3.4% on average
- PCK of 86.26% means 86% of predicted keypoints are within
  10% distance of the true location
- 16.6 FPS is suitable for real-time applications

CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------
The CNN model successfully learned to detect 21 body keypoints
from 2D character images with 86.26% accuracy. The model 
generalizes well to both human and anime-style characters.
